# Payroll-Report
This program displays a weekly payroll report. A loop in the 
program asks the user for the employee number, gross pay, state tax, 
federal tax, and FICA withholdings. The loop will terminate when 0 
is entered for the employee number. After the data is entered, 
the program displays totals for gross pay, state tax, federal tax, 
FICA withholdings, and net pay.  Input Validation: Do not accept 
negative numbers for any of the items entered. Do not accept values 
for state, federal, or FICA withholdings that are greater than the 
gross pay. If the sum state tax + federal tax + FICA withholdings 
for any employee is greater than gross pay, print an error message 
and ask the user to reenter the data for that employee.
